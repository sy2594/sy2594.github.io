Chapter 7: Software Engineering
software engineering- A software engineer is a person who applies the engineering design process to design, develop, maintain, test, and evaluate computer software.
integrated development environment (IDE) -  a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently.
Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)- The ACM is an umbrella organization for academic and scholarly interests in computer science (informatics).
  purpose of ACM - uniting computing educators, researchers and professionals to inspire dialogue, share resources and address the field's challenges.
  benefits of ACM membership - The opportunity to join one or more of ACM's Special Interest Groups in 37 specialty areas of IT.
  student ACM membership - Student Members. Thousands of online books, online courses, videos, and tutorials from Skillsoft covering the most in-demand skills, software, and technologies for computing professionals.
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (EEE) -  to foster technological innovation and excellence for the benefit of humanity.
  purpose of IEEE -  to foster technological innovation and excellence for the benefit of humanity.
  benefits of IEEE membership-  reduced rates on many proprietary products and services
  student IEEE membership - Online learning with more than 45 Professional Development Hours available.
Software Life Cycle: Development phase
  Requirements analysis-  the process of determining user expectations for a new or modified product.
  Design -  is the creation of a plan or convention for the construction of an object, system or measurable human interaction 
  Implementation - a realization of a technical specification or algorithm as a program, software component, or other computer system through computer programming and deployment.
  Testing- the process of evaluating and verifying that a software product or application does what it is supposed to do
modular implementation - consists in a sequence of implementation phrases.
Unifed Modeling Language (UML) - a standard notation for the modeling of real-world objects as a first step in developing an object-oriented design methodology.
use case - a written description of how users will perform tasks on your website.
use case diagram - a way to summarize details of a system and the users within that system
Data relationships:
  one-to-one - a process of providing all students with access to electronic devices, whether they be laptops, tablets, or any other form of device that can be used for learning.
  one-to-many - a type of cardinality that refers to the relationship between two entities
  many-to-many -  a relationship between several instances of one entity and multiple instances of another entity
design pattern - a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design.
Software quality assurance (SQA) -Design test plans, scenarios, scripts, or procedures
Software testing:
  glass box testing -  a testing technique that examines the program structure and derives test data from the program logic/code.
  black box testing -  a type of software testing in which the functionality of the software is not known. The testing is done without the internal knowledge of the products. 
  beta testing - a beta test is the second phase of software testing in which a sampling of the intended audience tries the product out.
  alpha testing - a type of software testing performed to identify bugs before releasing the product to real users or to the public.
Documentation:
  user documentation - any form of documentation intended for the end-user of a product or a service
  system documentation -  documents that describe the system itself and its parts.
  technical documentation -  any document that describes the microservice architecture or use of a software product.
Intellectual property law
  software license - the legal rights pertaining to the authorized use of digital material.
  software disclaimer-  the software developer's formal notice to the user of its software that the developer is denying any and all liability for any damages arising out of using the software as well as denying any implied warranties.
  best defenses against software liability claims (see last sentence in the chapter)
