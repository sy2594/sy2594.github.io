<tr>
<td>Machine language</td> 
 <td> Machine language is the language understood by a computer. It is very difficult to understand, but it is the only thing that the computer can work with.</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>      
<td>debugging:</td> 
	  <td>the process of identifying and removing errors from computer hardware or software.</td>
	 </tr>
 <tr>
<td>assembler:</td> 
	  <td>An assembler is a program that takes basic computer instructions and converts them into a pattern of bits that the computer's processor can use to perform its basic operations.</td>
	  </tr>
<tr>
<td>assembly language:</td> 
	  <td>a low-level symbolic code converted by an assembler.</td>
	 </tr>
<tr>
<td>translator:</td> 
	  <td>A translator is a program that converts source code into machine code.</td>
	 </tr>
<tr>
<td>compiler</td>: 
	  <td>A compiler is a special program that translates a programming language's source code into machine code, bytecode or another programming language.</td>
	 </tr>
<tr>
<td>interpreter:</td> 
	  <td>An interpreter is a computer program that is used to directly execute program instructions written using one of the many high-level programming languages.</td>
	 </tr>
<tr>
<td>cross-platform software:</td> 
	  <td>Cross-platform programming is the practice of deliberately writing software to work on more than one platform.</td>
	 </tr>
<tr>
<td>natural language:</td>
	  <td>the ability of a computer program to understand human language as it is spoken and written</td>
	 </tr>
<tr>
<td>formal language:</td> 
	  <td>A formal language is an abstract language used to express definitions, instructions and logic.</td>
	 </tr>
<tr>
<td>machine independence:</td> 
	  <td>A term applied to software that is not dependent on the properties of a particular machine, and can therefore be used on any machine. </td>
	 </tr>
<tr>
<td>high-level programming language:</td>  
	  <td>any programming language that enables development of a program in a much more user-friendly programming context and is generally independent of the computer's hardware architecture.</td>
	 </tr>
<tr>
<td>object-oriented programming (00P):</td>  
	  <td>a style of programming characterized by the identification of classes of objects closely linked with the methods (functions) with which they are associated.</td>
	 </tr>
<tr>
<td>scripting language:</td> 
	  <td>a programming language that employs a high-level construct to interpret and execute one command at a time</td>
	 </tr>
data types:
	integer:a positive or negative whole number, including 0.
	float:a function or reusable code in the Python programming language that converts values into floating point numbers.
	string:  a sequence of characters used to represent text.
primitive data type: a data type that is built into a programming language, or one that could be characterized as a basic structure for building more sophisticated data types.
data structure:  a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data.
Python collection data structures:
	list:an abstract data type that represents a finite number of ordered values, where the same value may occur more than once.
	tuple: an ordered sequence of elements of different data types,
	set: a data structure that stores unique elements of the same type in a sorted order.
	dictionary: an abstract data type that defines an unordered collection of data as a set of key-value pairs.
function:  a sequence of program instructions that performs a specific task, packaged as a unit.
local variable: a variable that is only accessible within a specific part of a program. 
global variable: a programming language construct, a variable type that is declared outside any function and is accessible to all functions throughout the program
source program:  programming statements that are created by a programmer with a text editor or a visual programming tool and then saved in a file
object program: a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.
