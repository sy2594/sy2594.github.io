<tr>
<td>Machine language</td> 
 <td> Machine language is the language understood by a computer. It is very difficult to understand, but it is the only thing that the computer can work with.</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>      
<td>Debugging</td> 
	  <td>The process of identifying and removing errors from computer hardware or software.</td>
	 </tr>
 <tr>
<td>Assembler</td> 
	  <td>An assembler is a program that takes basic computer instructions and converts them into a pattern of bits that the computer's processor can use to perform its basic operations.</td>
	  </tr>
<tr>
<td>Assembly language</td> 
	  <td>A low-level symbolic code converted by an assembler.</td>
	 </tr>
<tr>
<td>Translator</td> 
	  <td>A translator is a program that converts source code into machine code.</td>
	 </tr>
<tr>
<td>Compiler</td> 
	  <td>A compiler is a special program that translates a programming language's source code into machine code, bytecode or another programming language.</td>
	 </tr>
<tr>
<td>Interpreter</td> 
	  <td>An interpreter is a computer program that is used to directly execute program instructions written using one of the many high-level programming languages.</td>
	 </tr>
<tr>
<td>Cross-platform software</td> 
	  <td>Cross-platform programming is the practice of deliberately writing software to work on more than one platform.</td>
	 </tr>
<tr>
<td>Natural language</td>
	  <td>the ability of a computer program to understand human language as it is spoken and written</td>
	 </tr>
<tr>
<td>Formal language</td> 
	  <td>A formal language is an abstract language used to express definitions, instructions and logic.</td>
	 </tr>
<tr>
<td>Machine independence</td> 
	  <td>A term applied to software that is not dependent on the properties of a particular machine, and can therefore be used on any machine. </td>
	 </tr>
<tr>
<td>High-level programming language</td>  
	  <td>any programming language that enables development of a program in a much more user-friendly programming context and is generally independent of the computer's hardware architecture.</td>
	 </tr>
<tr>
<td>Object-oriented programming (00P)</td>  
	  <td>a style of programming characterized by the identification of classes of objects closely linked with the methods (functions) with which they are associated.</td>
	 </tr>
<tr>
<td>Scripting language</td> 
	  <td>a programming language that employs a high-level construct to interpret and execute one command at a time</td>
	 </tr>
<td colspan="2">Data&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Types</td>
<tr>
<td>Integer</td>
	  <td>a positive or negative whole number, including 0.</td>
	</tr>
<tr>
<td>Float</td>
	  <td>a function or reusable code in the Python programming language that converts values into floating point numbers.</td>
	</tr>
<tr>
<td>String</td> 
	  <td>a sequence of characters used to represent text.</td>
	 </tr>
<tr>
<td>Primitive data type</td> 
	  <td>a data type that is built into a programming language, or one that could be characterized as a basic structure for building more sophisticated data types.</td>
	 </tr>
<tr>
<td>Data structure</td> 
	  <td>a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data.</td>
	</tr>
<tr>
<td>Python collection data structures</td>
	<td> the fundamental constructs around which you build your programs.</td>

	<td>List</td>
	  <td>an abstract data type that represents a finite number of ordered values, where the same value may occur more than once.</td>

<tr>
<td>Tuple</td> 
	  <td>an ordered sequence of elements of different data types</td>
         </tr>
<tr>
<td>Set</td> 
	  <td>a data structure that stores unique elements of the same type in a sorted order.</td>
	</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dictionary</td>
	  <td>an abstract data type that defines an unordered collection of data as a set of key-value pairs.</td>

<tr>
<td>Function</td> 
	  <td>a sequence of program instructions that performs a specific task, packaged as a unit.</td>
