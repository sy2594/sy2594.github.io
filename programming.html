<h3>Phases of computer program development:</h3>
      <li>Phase 1: Understand the problem</li>
      <li>Phase 2: Design an algorithm to solve the problem</li>
      <li>Phase 3: Write the program code in appropriate language based on the algorithm</li>
      <li>Phase 4: Enter the program and save</li>
      <li>Phase 5: Execute the program</li>
      <li>Phase 6: Test the program, find errors and debug, then retest</li>
      <li>Phase s7: Document and evaluate the program</li>
<h3>Programming structures:</h3>
    <h3>Sequential structure: Top-down execution</h3>
    <h3>Decision structures: if/then/else</h3>
    <h3>Iterative (Looping):</h3>
        <li>while 1loop: continue 1oop√≠ng as long something is true</li>
        <li>repeat/until 1oop: continue 1oopi ng until something is true</li>
        <li>for loop: loop a given number of times</li>
    <h3>Recursive structures:</h3>
        <h3>Repeat a set of instructions as a subtask of itself</h3>
        <h3>Repetition continues until:</h3>
            <li>degenerative case, which is a termination condition, is met</li>
            <li>(degener ative case is also call ed a "base case")</li>
<h3>Two classic progr ammng/databas e problems</h3>
    <h3>Sorting: Descending order /As cending order</h3>
        <li>Sorting numbers</li>
        <li>Sorting strings (in accordance with ASCII values)</li>
    <h3>Searching: find specific data that meet a certain criteria</h3>
        <h3>In database:</h3>
              <li>FilterS: temporary search</li>
              <li>Queries: search criteria are saved so they don't have to be recreated</li>
        <h3>Two popular search techniques:</h3>
              <h3>Sequential search: search from top to bottom or bottom to top, one item at a time
              Binary search:</h3>
                  <li>only works if data is SORTED first</li>
                  <li>start in the middle, then go to half of that, etc.</li>
<h3>Two classic progr am goals:</h3>
      <li>Efficiency: Progr am takes minimal time and/or resources</li>
      <li>Correctness: Progr am runs in expected ways and works for all expected conditions</li>

<h2>Software testing and verification</h2>
      <h3>Kinds of tests:</h3>
(Find the definitions for these here: https://www. ibm. com/topi cs/software-testing)
            Acceptance testing: 
            Integration testing:
            Unit testing:
            Functionall testing:
            Performance testing:
            Regression testing:
            Stress testing:
            Usability testing:
      Software testing is done to detect:
            Architectural flaws
            Poor design decisions
            Invalid or incorrect functionality
            Security vulner abilities
            Scalability issues
      Testing best practices:
(explain these--see the IBM web site for the information)
            Continous testing
            Configur ation management
            ServiC Virtualizati on
            Defect or "bug tracking"
            Metrics and reporting
